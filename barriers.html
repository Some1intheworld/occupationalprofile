        <h2>Financial</h2>
        <p>
          Getting a degree from a university/college related to this field is
          very expensive. Getting a bachelor of information technology at
          Ontario Tech University costs up to $9000 for domestic students,
          excluding the ancillary fees.
        </p>
        <h3>How to overcome?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply to OSAP for financial assistance</li>
          <li>Working part-time to earn and save some money</li>
          <li>Ask parents for financial aid</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Finding a Job</h2>
        <p>
          Game design is a highly competitive field, and junior designers could
          struggle to find a job without prior experience. Building a strong
          portfolio is also crucial. Finding a job in big companies and earning
          a high income can be very challenging for a junior designer as well
        </p>
        <h3>How to overcome?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Start early and gain experience</li>
          <li>
            Connect and get to know people in this field of work to gain insight
            and tips
          </li>
          <li>Start small, work for a small company or clients first</li>
          <li>
            Make small and big projects along the way to build up the portfolio
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Work Hours</h2>
        <p>
          Game designers often work under pressure for long hours, sometimes
          overtime and on weekends when they have to hit a deadline. This can be
          stressful and overwhelming to those who canâ€™t handle it, and it could
          be particularly challenging for new designers in their early years
        </p>
        <h3>How to overcome?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Seek help from others, preferably those who work in similar fields
            or have similar work conditions
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare and get used to working under pressure and overtime during
            university
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice time management and focus skills early to maximize
            productivity in the future and reduce work hours
          </li>
        </ul>
