            The demand for game designers is expected to go up in the future,
            nationwide and in Canada, and has been rising since 2019. Game
            designers are also highly in demand all over the world, and this is
            because more and more people are playing video games these days, and
            the number will continue to increase considering that kids today are
            getting technology early in their lives.

            Globally, there are approximately 3 billion people who play video
            games, and in Canada, approximately 23 million Canadians play video
            games, ranging from kids to adults, and that number is expected to
            grow. Moreover, the gaming industry contributed $5.5 billion to the
            countryâ€™s GDP in 2021 and is expected to continue growing by around
            13% from 2024 to 2029. Furthermore, the Government of Canada Job
            Bank anticipated a labour shortage of game developers in 2031, which
            means game designers and developers will be even more in demand in
            the future in Canada.

            With this knowledge in mind, I know that the gaming industry will
            continue to grow, including game designers, and there will be more
            and more jobs offered. Since there will be many opportunities, I
            will use them to build up my experience and profile by working for
            smaller company or client that are easier to get in, and start
            applying for bigger company and corporations, which is where I wish
            to work at the end.
